Linear Regression Model using Rust to predict the output of the fuction y = 2x + 1

The project involves developing of a Linear Regression Model  using Rust,The project must predict an output of the fuction y = 2x +1.It is designed to show the basic the principles of Linear regression ,how to measure performance and and how to implement it from stratch.

The main challenge is to get the model to learn relationships between inputs and outputs.

Three applications need to be installed for the operation oft he project
1.Rust :https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
2.Rustrover:https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/.
Cargo:This  is included in the in the Rust Installation

For the project setup  a repository must be cloned  using  github( github.com),The necessary dependencies must be used on Cargo.toml.

The project is expected to predict values for x,and compare actual and predicted values.

I had a challenges with running the programme ,I had a few errors I couldnt resolve,I also receievd a few warnings due to fuctions that have changed .

I learnert how to build a project from starch using Rust for the first time and using resources like AI to gather my information .I got to understand Linear regression fuctions .Working with Rust sort of like improved my programming skills.
