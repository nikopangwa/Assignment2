Linear Regression with Burn in Rust

This repository contains a simple implementation of a linear regression model using the Burn deep learning framework (version 0.16.0) in Rust. The project includes generating synthetic data, defining the model, training it, and evaluating its performance.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a basic linear regression model using Rust and the Burn library while following strict dependency requirements. The repository documents the approach used for building, training, and evaluating the model.

Features

Synthetic data generation for training and testing

Linear regression model implementation using Burn

Model training with gradient descent optimization

Performance evaluation and visualization of results

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Rust (latest stable version)

Cargo

Burn v0.16.0



Setup

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

Install dependencies:

cargo build

Usage

Run the training script:

cargo run

The script will generate synthetic data, train the linear regression model, and display the results.

Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

[dependencies]
burn = "0.16.0"
burn-autodiff = "0.16.0"
burn-tensor = { version = "0.16.0", features = ["ndarray"] }
rand = "0.8"

Results

The model's performance is evaluated based on the loss function. After training, the script prints the final loss and model parameters. Future improvements could include adding visualization for better interpretability.
